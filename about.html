        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Marc, your local IT expert.

            Technology has been my passion and profession for over 25 years. I started my career as a Geek Squad In-Home Technician, helping everyday people navigate their tech challenges. From there, I transitioned into enterprise IT, cybersecurity, and data engineering, working in industries like finance, healthcare, and consulting. My experience ranges from troubleshooting home networks to securing corporate systems for 1,000+ users.
            
            Now, I’m bringing that expertise back to where it all started—helping individuals and small businesses in Highland Park. I understand how frustrating tech issues can be, whether it’s a slow computer, Wi-Fi problems, data security concerns, or just making sense of today’s technology. My goal is simple: take the stress out of tech so you can focus on what matters.
            
            Unlike big-box stores or faceless call centers, I take a one-on-one approach, offering local, reliable, and personalized tech support you can trust. Whether you need a quick fix, ongoing IT support, or cybersecurity advice, I’m here to help.
                    
            
            </p>
        <p>Local. Experienced. Ready to Help.</p>
