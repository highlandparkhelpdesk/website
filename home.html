        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Marc, your local IT expert. Technology has been my passion and profession for over 25 years. I started my career as a Geek Squad In-Home Technician, helping people and businesses navigate their tech challenges. From there, I transitioned into enterprise IT, cybersecurity, and data engineering, working at Fortune 500 companies in finance, healthcare, and consulting. My experience ranges from troubleshooting home networks to building, maintaining, and securing corporate systems for thousands of users. Now, Iâ€™m bringing that expertise back to where it all startedâ€”helping individuals and small businesses in Highland Park. I understand how frustrating tech issues can be, whether itâ€™s a slow computer, Wi-Fi problems, data security concerns, or just making sense of todayâ€™s technology. My goal is simple: take the stress out of tech so you can focus on what matters. Unlike big-box stores or faceless call centers, I take a one-on-one approach, offering local, reliable, and personalized tech support you can trust. Whether you need a quick fix, ongoing IT support, or cybersecurity advice, Iâ€™m here to help.</p>
        <p><strong>Local. Experienced. Ready to Help.</strong></p>
